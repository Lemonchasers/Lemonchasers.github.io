# DSC-680-Portfolio
# Document Similarity

This was an exercise from DSC 550 where we first began jumping into text analysis. 
This was a challenge at the time because it was brand new working with text. I have gone on to 
further working with text at my work, but this was a great building block exercise for that.

### Summary
This file is a building block for learning about jaccard distance and cosine similarity. This has gone on to be implemented in other project of mine.
