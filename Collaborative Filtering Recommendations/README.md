In this section, there is another version of a movie recommendation model.
However, it is active and needs input in order to provide a recommendation.

### Summary
This is another recommendation model for movies. However, the dataset provided for this assignment was different than the Netflix dataset. As well, the other difference is being able to have an interactive jupyter notebook in order to take inputs from someone and then model based on their inputs.
