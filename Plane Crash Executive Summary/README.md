# DSC-680-Portfolio
# Business Intelligence

For this section of the portfolio, I wanted to showcase the BI side of data analytics. 
As important as it is to script and be able to implement models, one needs to be able to
also share their ideas and present on them.

### Summary
This assignment was an executive summary dashboard page that tried to effectively answer the question, is media oversensationalizing plane crashes to the point where people think it is less safe to travel by air compared to other modes of transportation? The answer in short is that flying by plane is still more safe than other modes of transportation and in fact flying by aircraft is safer now than it ever has been.
