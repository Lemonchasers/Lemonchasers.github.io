# DSC-680-Portfolio
# Python Data Visualization

This section will be a cumulation of data visualizations from Python that all came from DSC 640.

### Summary
DSC 540 was a class specifically focused on visualizations and business intelligence. There were 10 weeks and every two weeks, assignments were due. Thus, every two weeks we had to create a list of visuals in Python. These files are the compilation of all of the visuals asked for over the entire quarter.
