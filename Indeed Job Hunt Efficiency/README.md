# Text Similarity and Business Intelligence

This section of work focuses on themes of taking text similarity, trying to do process improvement, and then combines it with business intelligence. 


### Summary
This project takes a resume and then indeed job requisition descriptions and compares the documents. Specifically, it takes a look at the nouns and verbs present in both the resume and description and then takes the cosine similarity score.

Then the results are placed into a power bi dashboard in order to make the job hunt more efficient.
